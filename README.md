The user can add custom settings such as multiple World ID recover persons.
But also the need for a certain number of proofs to recover the assests like 2/3, almost like multi-sig.

We also implemented the passkeys to create a new Safe smart wallet.

One of the use case we can think of in the future would be for a notary to have a recover access to transfer to the heirs after his client passes away.
